<p><strong>Android WiFi scanning throttling</strong></p>
<h5>Android 8.0 and Android 8.1:</h5>
Each background app can scan one time in a 30-minute period.
<h5>Android 9:</h5>
Each foreground app can scan four times in a 2-minute period. This allows for a burst of scans in a short time.

All background apps combined can scan one time in a 30-minute period.

<h5>Android 10 and higher:</h5>
The same throttling limits from Android 9 apply. There is a new developer option to toggle the throttling off under Settings > Developer Options > Networking > Wi-Fi scan throttling.

    <strong>Location Service Permission Requirements</strong>
    <p>Since the latest release of Android OS 9 (Pie), location services permission is required for WiFi scanning to function. As a result, we had to update the application to request these permissions. As always, we will not store or transmit your location information at any time - privacy is important! However, for those users who wish to remain using the old version of the application, it will be available for any Android device using Android 8 (Oreo) and lower OS for a period of time.</p>
    <h5>Play Store Instructions:</h5>
    <p>To install old version, just uninstall the latest version of the application from your device, go to the play store and install the application. It will automatically install old version, as long as device is not running Android 9 (Pie). Do not forget to disable automatic update.</p>

    <h5>Android OS 6 may require Location Service to be switched on</h5>
    <p>Some users running Android OS 6+ (Marshmallow) have reported that the location service must be enabled for the application to see WiFi networks. Users using the the above versions of Android OS may need to turn on the location service, even though WiFi Analyzer does not explicitly require it. This appears to be attributed to permission model changes since Android Marshmallow, the knowledge of nearby WiFi access points is regarded as containing location information and is protected by location permission.</p>
